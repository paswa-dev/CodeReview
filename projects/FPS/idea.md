## Idea
> Camera is strictly set to follow movement of head. This way you can pivot the root and angle the entire body. 
> Viewmodel on client, information sent across server

> For lookvector replication, strictly pivot arms/head in direction. Recoil replication will be simulated per client.
## Pros
> Replicates
## Cons
